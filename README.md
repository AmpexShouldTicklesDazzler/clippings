A parser/generator for Kindle-format clipping files (`My Clippings.txt`),
written in Haskell. I wrote this to help import my highlights into
[Mnemosyne](http://mnemosyne-proj.org/), after noticing that there were many
books I could remember having read, but very few I could describe the specifics
of.
